                The European Convention Center Luxembourg consists of two
                buildings dedicated to corporate and government events: the main
                building and the hemicycle. Every year, it hosts more than 400
                events, all tailor-made and in an exceptional setting in the
                heart of Luxembourg's Kirchberg business district. It offers a
                wide range of services that customers don't have to worry about
                during their event: Cleaning, security, catering and a wide
                range of technical equipment. Three times a year, the ECCL hosts
                the European Council of Ministers, which fully privatizes the
                premises and incorporates its own security elements.

                As Event Assistant, I was in charge of supporting the work of
                Grégory, Event Manager at ECCL for almost 10 years. We took over
                from our sales colleagues as soon as the rental contract was
                signed by the customer. I was in charge of coordinating the
                various players involved in making a good event: technical,
                security, cleaning, catering, the direct customer and, very
                often, external service providers. I was also close to the
                customers, guiding them in their choice of services within the
                ECCL. I also worked on the event follow-up part, for which we
                produced the annual activity report with the rest of the team.

                During this 6-month period, I discovered the world of business
                events. A facet of the events that I had never explored before.
                I learned to perfect my personal service and to become more
                demanding with myself to deliver quality work that meets
                customer expectations. It's an exercise that has given me a lot
                in terms of self-perception. Managing a 3,500 m² building and
                coordinating 5 to 6 different departments requires clarity and
                rigor in one's work in order to distribute information
                correctly.

            In July 2023, as my professional situation allowed, I decided to
            leave my native region to put an end to a 5-year long-distance
            relationship with my partner who lives in Thionville. It was after a
            period of job hunting in the region that I found my first position
            at ECCL. I'm very proud to have taken this step, as it perfectly
            reflects my state of mind from that moment on. It's a period of
            transition in my life, but above all a new beginning.

                conferences to the biggest festivals, it's hard to miss when it

                At Alive, I've held two positions that have both taught me a
                lot. First, I was a stock manager in the lighting section of the
                equipment pool. I was in charge of equipment maintenance and
                organizing the departure and return of equipment. I then worked
                as a sales representative for Alive's broadcast division, which
                specializes in rental of equipment for filming. I was in close
                contact with Alive's "small" customers to offer them a
                tailor-made rental service that met their expectations.

              <p class="alive-card-back card-back">
                In both positions, priority has always been given to the quality
                of service and equipment offered to customers. I've rubbed
                shoulders with a lot of industry professionals, both internal
                and external. It was at Alive that I most developed my
                adaptability and organizational skills. These are essential
                qualities in an environment where everything has to be redone
                for each new project.

                I can't introduce you to the Swedish furniture giant, but I can

                when my freelance event management business was at a low ebb and
                I was nearing the end of my studies. This opportunity came just
                before the Covid crisis, which completely paralyzed the events
                industry. So at the very least, I had this activity to make a
                bit of money.

                At Ikea, I was a sales assistant in the Tableware department. I
                was in charge of stocking the shelves, making sure they were

                with all the other departments in the store to promote Ikea's
                values to our customers.

                In the sound option, I discovered how to professionally produce
                a sound production, from its raw capture to its final mix. The
                main technical objective was to make the audio content as pure
                as possible, so as to offer an exceptional final rendering to
                the editor in charge of video assembly. We were also in charge

                Although I didn't always focus on sound, which was my chosen
                field of study, my freelance work offered me a wide range of
                assignments. Both in the region and throughout France, thanks to
                my collaborations with numerous players in the sector, I was in
                charge of installing all types of equipment for all types of
                events. Whether it was an electrical installation for an open
                market in the south of France, or setting up a student party at
                a prestigious school in Lille, I was never bored.

                In November 2021, after many collaborations with Alive, a
                contract opportunity arose at a time in my life when I was
                considering buying my first property. I decided to accept
                Alive's offer without forgetting my unique freelance experience.

                This technological BAC is purely oriented towards sustainable
                development and its link with industrial professions. When I
                took this exam, there were 4 options: digital, eco-design,
                energy and architecture. It's a BAC that opens the door to many
                different sectors, thanks to its versatility and modernity. At
                my school, the classrooms were very well equipped for this kind
                of practice. For example, a 3D printer was available right in
                our classroom for designing our projects.

                I chose the ITEC option (Technological Innovation and
                Eco-design) in which I learned how to carry out a project by
                starting with an idea, then drawing up specifications,
                conceptualizing the project using 3D software and finally
                materializing the project using 3D printing. I learned how to
                defend a project in front of a panel of judges and highlight its
                strengths and advantages.

                After these studies, which I really enjoyed and learned a lot
                from, I decided to change direction and go into a sector that
                intrigued me: audiovisual. My father had worked in the events
                industry for a long time, so he was able to guide me in my
                choice of direction. I was convinced that I could only succeed
                in this field if I put all my passion and ambition into it.

          <h3>About my skills</h3>
          <p>
            In the course of my career, I've met many professionals from a wide
            variety of sectors, and I've been able to confirm a long-held
            assumption: a job well done is always born of passion. I was able to
            experiment with many different working methods, and this helped me
            understand which ones suited me best. As a self-taught person, I've
            been able to fuel my curiosity through research and thus develop a
            strong interest in programming. Despite my young experience, I know
            how to work efficiently and appropriately on a project, using all
            the tools at my disposal to deliver good quality content for both
            the customer and collaborators.

            Without this asset, I certainly wouldn't have put up with changing
            direction so regularly. I've often questioned my life paths, but
            I've never given in to stress or abandonment. I'm confident in
            myself and I know my limits, so I've always known how to act in
            different situations. I naturally like to take a step back whenever
            I feel I'm missing a detail or not mastering a subject properly. I
            consider stress management to be the number one quality of a good
            collaborator.

            To achieve optimal results, it's imperative to know how to
            communicate with the rest of your team. Sharing information avoids
            both making mistakes and missing an opportunity to optimize one's
            own work and that of others. I've worked a lot on my ability to make
            suggestions, particularly at Ikea, Alive and ECCL, where this aspect
            is a fundamental pillar of overall work balance.

            Working with a wide variety of people has enabled me to develop good
            elocution, whether with customers or colleagues. For me, knowing how
            to adapt my speech to suit the person in question is proof of my
            ability to pay close attention to others. This ability allows me to
            develop a feeling of trust and comfort with the person, thus
            multiplying the possibilities for dialogue. It goes without saying
            that respect for the client is a fundamental value of my
            relationship methods, whether in dialogue or interaction.

            This asset has developed in me over the years. I'm very curious by
            nature and like to develop my knowledge of the subjects I study.
            Knowing a subject without understanding its inner workings is an
            unpleasant feeling for me. As a result, I've naturally developed a
            keen sense of analysis and observation of the world around me. I
            think it's vital to apply this value to the workplace, as it enables
            me to stay alert and deliver quality work. I believe that the human
            brain needs to be stimulated by its five senses to work optimally.

          <p>
            In my spare time, I like to invest time in a healthy lifestyle, as
            it enables me to concentrate better when I'm working. In fact, I
            personally believe that there is a trinity in well-being, the
            various subjects of which do not function properly without each
            other: Sport, nutrition and sleep. Each of these three subjects has
            a variety of very interesting details, but they only reveal their
            true potential when applied together. Of course, I remain flexible
            to life's events, but I try to apply these principles to the letter
            in order to preserve my health and balance. I hope everyone will
            discover the benefits of the effective fusion of these three
            elements.

          <h3>CAM</h3>
          <p>
            I discovered computer-assisted music at the age of 17, two years
            before starting my BTS in sound. I come from a Polish family for
            whom music is part of every meal. Singing, violins, accordion and
            double bass rocked my entire youth, and I owe them a great deal for
            instilling in me what is for me the primary interest of music:
            creating memories. I didn't play any instruments on a regular basis,
            despite this and two years of music theory, followed by the purchase
            of a piano at the age of 12 and a ukulele much later, which I still
            carry with me when I move house. CAM, however, gave me the
            beginnings of my desire to build with my hands on digital
            technology. With my sound software, I have the impression that I can
            reproduce any sound and arrange them in my own way, without having
            to be a conductor or know how to play 5 different instruments.
            Composing is an escape that instantly reconnects me with my musical
            identity.

          <p>
            It's a passion that's been with me since childhood. I played my
            first game at the age of eight. It was Pokemon on Nintendo advance
            SP. I remember it like it was yesterday! And since then, I've always
            been able to find free time to devote to this escape. Sometimes too
            much, but fortunately I've got a circle of friends who love me and
            know how to call me to order. I've had several different consoles,
            but nowadays I mainly play on the computer, with a wide variety of
            game types and genres, such as RPGs (Role Play Games) and MMOs
            (Massively Multiplayer Online).
